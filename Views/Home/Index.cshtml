                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the site for managing Nike shipments entrusted to the Bartolini courier. To manage the addresses of your orders, just go to the Script - Nike Brt section and fill in your data. The script will do everything by itself and within minutes you will have changed your shipping address.
It may happen that the script gives error 403, if this error appears try to launch it again.
If you want to make more addresses and you don't want to always fill out the form, just fill out the form once and then click on the fill in again button and a new screen will appear. At this point you will only need to replace the order number and email.

For assistance, contact us via our Discord channel</p>
